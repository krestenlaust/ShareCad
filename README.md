# Installation
The files are located in `Binaries/`.
The ShareCad.dll is to be built manually with the ShareCad-project files. I am looking into making a release with all prebuilt binaries in one place (#2).

- 1. Replace MathcadPrime.exe in PTC\Mathcad Prime 4.0
- 2. Drag 0Harmony.dll into PTC\Mathcad Prime 4.0
- 3. Drag ShareCad.dll into PTC\Mathcad Prime 4.0
